Mesomorphs are known for a more muscular and athletic physique. They tend to have a naturally higher percentage of muscle mass, a broader shoulder-to-hip ratio, and an easier time gaining both muscle and strength. Endomorphs typically have a softer, rounder physique with a higher tendency to store body fat. They may have a slower metabolism and find it easier to gain weight."
